# Loan Prediction Model

This repository contains a loan prediction model developed using a Random Forest Classifier. The model is designed to predict loan approval status based on key borrower attributes, including income, credit history, loan amount, and more. This project is particularly useful for financial institutions looking to automate the loan approval process and identify applicants with a high likelihood of repayment.

## Overview

Loan prediction models help in the early detection of default risk and can be an integral part of a credit scoring system. This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to make predictions based on various borrower attributes. By examining multiple factors, the model helps to automate the decision-making process for loan approvals.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes information on borrowers such as:
- Applicant’s income
- Coapplicant’s income
- Loan amount
- Loan term
- Credit history
- Property area, and more.

Each entry in the dataset has a label indicating whether a loan was approved or not. For this project, you can use a public loan prediction dataset (e.g., from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)).

## Modeling Approach

The model leverages a **Random Forest Classifier**, a powerful and interpretable machine learning algorithm known for handling non-linear relationships and feature interactions effectively.

Steps involved:
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling
2. Model Training:
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets
   - Training the Random Forest Classifier
   - Hyperparameter tuning for optimization
3. Evaluation:
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics
   - Confusion matrix analysis

## Technologies Used

- **Python** - Programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation
- **Scikit-Learn** - Machine learning framework
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive computing environment

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/auhonab/loan-prediction-model.git
cd loan-prediction-model
```

Then, install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset:** Load the dataset in CSV format. Ensure that the column names match the requirements in the notebook.
2. **Run the Notebook:** Open `Loan_Prediction_Model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to view each step of the analysis and model building.
3. **Predict New Data:** Use the `predict.py` script to make predictions on new data entries.

Example:

```python
python predict.py --input <input_file.csv>
```

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of around **85%** on the test set, with an F1-score of approximately **0.82**. These metrics indicate that the Random Forest model is effective for predicting loan approval but could be improved further with additional data and feature engineering.

**Confusion Matrix:**
- True Positive: X
- False Positive: Y
- True Negative: Z
- False Negative: W

## Future Enhancements

- **Feature Engineering:** Explore more domain-specific features to improve model performance.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Test additional ensemble methods, like boosting, to further improve accuracy.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the model as a REST API for real-time predictions in production.
